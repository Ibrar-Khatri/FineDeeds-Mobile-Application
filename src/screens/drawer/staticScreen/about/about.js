              Finedeeds provides you a platform to engage with nonprofits in a
              meaningful way. While monetary or material donations are a way to
              help those in need, there is a gap in the humanitarian aid
              sector.The gaps are:

            <ResponsiveText style={style.contentText} size={12}>
              - Non-profit organizations struggle to find volunteers to work
              when they need them.
            </ResponsiveText>
            <ResponsiveText style={style.contentText} size={12}>
              - They also lack resources who can handle their admin,
              marketing,promotional, or specific events related to ad-hoc work
              or have to spend a fortune on that. Money that could otherwise be
              used to achieve its goals.

            <ResponsiveText style={style.contentText} size={12}>
              - There are people who want to help non-profits by means of their
              skills and in their own time but they do not find the right
              opportunities.
