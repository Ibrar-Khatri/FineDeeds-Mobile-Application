              Finedeeds provides you a platform to engage with nonprofits in a
              meaningful way. While monetary or material donations are a way to
              help those in need, there is a gap in the humanitarian aid

            <Text style={style.contentText}>
              - They also lack resources who can handle their admin,
              marketing,promotional, or specific events related to ad-hoc work
              or have to spend a fortune on that. Money that could otherwise be
              used to achieve its goals.

              - There are people who want to help non-profits by means of their
